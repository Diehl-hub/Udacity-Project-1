# Udacity-Project-1
Project for Udacity Nanodegree

Prior to 2020 it was a privilege to have the ability to work from home, something that was nice to have yet for the most part we all went to work in the mornings then went home in the evenings. 

Now 2024 and it seems that the work from home privilege has become the norm for several professions.
Thru the StackOverflow Survey of professional programmers we have look in the age, employment statsus and the style of work (be it in person, at home or a hybrid of both) in this profession. 
We are looking for any type of indicators that may help with further analysis of a topic that has begin to change the landscape of so many jod sectors.

Can you do your work from home, if so why dont you?
